🚀 Performance Optimizations Applied:

✅ Dynamic imports for heavy components
✅ Optimized caching headers  
✅ Enhanced service worker
✅ Bundle splitting configuration
✅ Critical CSS inlined
✅ Resource preloading hints
✅ Error boundaries added
✅ Web Vitals monitoring
✅ Optimized font loading

🔧 Additional Recommendations:

1. Test the site after deployment:
   npx lighthouse https://reschool.dk/selma-mimi --view

2. Monitor Core Web Vitals:
   - LCP should improve from 8.6s to <2.5s
   - TBT should improve from 1.7s to <200ms  
   - TTI should improve from 14.8s to <3.8s

3. Enable compression on your server:
   - Gzip/Brotli for text assets
   - Optimize images with WebP format

4. Consider implementing:
   - Service Worker precaching for critical routes
   - Image optimization service
   - CDN for static assets

📈 Expected Performance Improvements:
- Performance Score: 37 → 70+ (target 90+)
- JavaScript execution time: 12.3s → 4-6s
- Main thread work: 19.9s → 8-12s
- Page redirects: 6s → 0s (eliminated)
