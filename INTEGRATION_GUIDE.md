# Stack Auth + Neon Database Integration Guide

## Current Setup Analysis

You have:
- ✅ Stack Auth configured for user authentication
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL database configured
- ❌ No connection between the two systems

## Integration Options

### Option 1: Stack Auth as Primary (Recommended)
Keep Stack Auth managing users, sync data to Neon when needed.

**Pros:**
- Full authentication features (social login, password reset, etc.)
- No need to implement auth yourself
- Stack Auth handles security best practices

**Implementation:**
- Use Stack Auth for all user operations
- Sync user data to Neon only for application-specific needs
- Store course data, progress, etc. in Neon with Stack Auth user IDs

### Option 2: Hybrid Approach
Use Stack Auth for authentication, immediately sync all users to Neon.

**Implementation:**
1. Set up user table in Neon with Stack Auth user ID as foreign key
2. Create webhooks or middleware to sync users on signup/update
3. Use Neon for all user queries in your application

### Option 3: Migrate to Neon Only (Not Recommended)
Move all user management to Neon and stop using Stack Auth.

**Cons:**
- You'll lose social logins, password reset, etc.
- Need to implement auth security yourself
- More maintenance overhead

## Recommended Implementation

### 1. Create User Schema in Neon

```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  stack_auth_id VARCHAR(255) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  display_name VARCHAR(255),
  profile_image_url TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  course_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
  progress INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Sync Strategy
- Keep Stack Auth as the source of truth for authentication
- Sync user data to Neon on first login or when needed
- Use Neon for storing application data (courses, progress, etc.)

### 3. User Flow
1. User signs up/logs in via Stack Auth
2. On dashboard access, check if user exists in Neon
3. If not, create user record in Neon with Stack Auth ID
4. Use Neon for all application data queries

## Next Steps

1. Set up database schema in Neon
2. Implement user sync function
3. Add sync call to dashboard/middleware
4. Test the integration

Would you like me to implement any of these approaches?
